<p>This is how I connected to the Penn. State wireless network (2.0) with GNU/Linux and wpa_supplicant. Here is the network information from PSU:</p>

<p>
<b>SSID:</b> psu<br>
<b>Security:</b> WPA2-Enterprise<br>
<b>Encryption:</b> AES<br>
<b>Authentication Type:</b> EAP-TTLS<br>
<b>Authentication Protocol:</b> PAP<br>
<b>Certificate Authority:</b> Thawte Premium Server CA
</p>

<p>The following configuration block needs to be entered into /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">
network={
    ssid="psu"
    identity="your_access_id_here"
    password="your_password_here"
    key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
    eap=TTLS
    phase2="auth=PAP"
    ca_cert="/etc/ssl/certs/Thawte_Premium_Server_CA.pem"
}
</pre>

Check that your wireless card is up with `ifconfig` and that you are in range of an access point with `iwlist scan`. You can now connect using wpa_supplicant and dhcpcd. Change the following line to use your wireless driver and interface.

<pre class="brush: bash">
wpa_supplicant -B -D wext -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
dhcpcd wlan0
</pre>
