<p>I've searched for a CMS to use. I want something small, to edit my notes in Vim and sort them easily in code. I finally decided to write a pagination script for the site, and use the MySQL shell to keep track of things. Python scripts take care of the most repetitive tasks.</p>
<pre class="brush: sql">
mysql&#62; SHOW tables FROM dylanstestserver;
+----------------------------+
| Tables_in_dylanstestserver |
+----------------------------+
| notes                      |
| comments                   |
+----------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
</pre>
<p>Once everything was running the way I wanted on my development stack, it was a one line command to copy over the database.</p>
<pre class="brush: bash">
mysqldump dylanstestserver -p | mysql -u dylan -h dylanstestserver.com -D dylanstestserver -p
</pre>
